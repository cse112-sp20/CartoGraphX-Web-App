# CartoGraphX Web App

The CartoGraphX Web App is used to display the tracked user-metrics gathered by the CartoGraphX VSCode extension. Currently, the project structure and the current editors of each file are displayed. This tool will greatly increase accountability because each developerâ€™s work will be visible in real time.

## Running the web app
To run the web app and see your changes reflected, you can follow the instructions under the "Development" section. You can then log in using the account you've created in the VS Code Extension. You will then be able to view maps you've created by using the team map ID code specified in the extension.

## Features

CartoGraphX users are able to sign into the sign in using an email address and password created through the exentension.

When signed in, a user can delete their account, sign out, or display one of their project maps using an existing team map ID.
