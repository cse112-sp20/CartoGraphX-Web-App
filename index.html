                    <h3>What is CartoGraphX?</h3>
                    <p id="about-text-entry">CartoGraphX is a combination of a VS Code extension and a web application that provides software development teams with a way to visualize their coding projects! Our software utilizes the files in a project in order to create a map that helps developers understand the relationships between the files they are working in much like the one displayed to the right.</p>
                    <h3>Who is CartoGraphX for?</h3>
                    <p id="about-text-entry">We created CartoGraphX for software development teams. Our application facilitates team interaction and keeps track of what files each member of a team is working on.</p>
                    <h3>Why do you need CartoGraphX?</h3>
                    <ul id="about-text-entry">
                      <li><strong>How long do you spend trying to understand the files in a project before you actually begin working?</strong></br>A map might make your life easier…</li>
                      <li><strong>How long do you spend trying to understand code you didn’t write?</strong></br>Knowing exactly who worked on which file and when would be nice wouldn’t it? We did that for you.</li>
                      <li><strong>How often are you actually collaborating with your team in a remote setting?</strong></br>Our platform allows you to take full advantage of your teammates, increasing general productivity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What Inspired CartoGraphX?</h3>
                    <p>Like any solution, CartoGraphX is a response to a problem, or rather a series of problems. Some of those issues have been affecting software development teams for a long time and others have recently come to light with the current global situation. The problems that CartoGraphX aims to mitigate are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Developers often don’t understand the full scope of the projects they work on. Instead, they focus on the area of the project where they are actually writing code and don’t pay much attention to the rest of the project. This is problematic because developers are essentially trying to solve a problem with partial information. Our map provides software teams with an easier way of understanding the full scope of a project.</li>
                      <li>Remote working has led to a lack of accountability in that developers are left to manage their own time without much supervision. Additionally, with people working at home, there are many more distractions that lead to a fall in productivity. In order to address these issues, our platform keeps track of where coders are working. It places software developers on an “idle island” if their VS code is left untouched for enough time when they should be working. This helps team managers see what their developers are doing and consequently keeps coders focused and on task.</li>
                      <li>Software developers often have a hard time resolving bugs because they deal with code they didn’t write and therefore don’t completely understand. Our map keeps track of who worked in each file. This means that if a coder runs into an issue in a file or area of the program they don’t fully understand, they can easily see who worked on these files last and can contact them to get help!</li>
                      <li>Remote working has decreased team interaction further because people are no longer forced to see each other everyday. This is problematic because it affects team morale and reduces team communication in general. CartoGraphX aims to help keep teams connected by providing a platform where teams can work simultaneously.</li>
